    content: "The first few days and weeks are crucial for establishing successful breastfeeding:",
    tips: [
      "Start breastfeeding as soon as possible after birth - ideally within the first hour.",
      "Feed on demand, which means whenever your baby shows hunger cues (rooting, sucking motions, bringing hands to mouth).",
      "Newborns typically feed 8-12 times in 24 hours - this is normal and helps establish your milk supply.",
      "Ensure a good latch: baby's mouth should cover most of the areola, not just the nipple.",
      "Watch for signs of good feeding: you hear swallowing, baby seems content after feeding, and your breasts feel softer.",
      "Let your baby finish one breast before offering the other - this ensures they get the nutrient-rich hindmilk.",
      "Don't worry about schedules initially - frequent feeding is normal and helps build your supply."
    ],
    importantNote: "If you experience pain during feeding or your baby isn't gaining weight, seek help from a lactation consultant or healthcare provider."

    content: "A good latch is essential for comfortable and effective breastfeeding:",
    tips: [
      "Position yourself comfortably with good back support - use pillows to support your arms and baby.",
      "Hold your baby close with their nose level with your nipple - wait for a wide-open mouth.",
      "Bring baby to your breast, not your breast to baby - this helps with proper positioning.",
      "Baby's chin should touch your breast first, with their head slightly tilted back.",
      "Check that baby's lips are flanged outward (like a fish) and covering most of the areola.",
      "Common positions: cradle hold, cross-cradle, football hold, or side-lying (great for night feeds).",
      "If latch is painful, break the suction gently with your finger and try again."
    ],
    importantNote: "Breastfeeding shouldn't be painful once established. If you experience persistent pain, seek help from a lactation consultant."

    content: "Building and maintaining a good milk supply is important for your baby's nutrition:",
    tips: [
      "Feed frequently - the more you feed, the more milk you produce (supply and demand principle).",
      "Ensure your baby is effectively removing milk - a good latch is crucial.",
      "Stay hydrated - drink water whenever you feel thirsty, especially while feeding.",
      "Eat a balanced diet with enough calories - breastfeeding burns extra calories.",
      "Rest when possible - fatigue can affect milk production.",
      "Avoid pacifiers and bottles in the early weeks to establish breastfeeding first.",
      "Consider pumping after feeds if you want to build a stash or increase supply."
    ],
    importantNote: "Most women produce enough milk. If you're concerned about supply, consult a lactation consultant before supplementing with formula."

    tips: [
      "Sore nipples: Ensure proper latch, let nipples air dry after feeding, use lanolin cream.",
      "Engorgement: Feed frequently, use warm compresses before feeding, cold compresses after.",
      "Blocked ducts: Massage the area, feed from that breast first, vary feeding positions.",
      "Mastitis: Rest, continue breastfeeding, use warm compresses, contact your doctor if you have a fever.",
      "Low supply concerns: Feed more frequently, ensure good latch, stay hydrated and well-nourished.",
      "Baby refusing breast: Check for illness, try different positions, ensure baby isn't too sleepy or too hungry.",
      "Growth spurts: Baby may feed more frequently - this is normal and temporary."
    ],
    importantNote: "Most breastfeeding challenges can be resolved with proper support. Don't hesitate to seek help from lactation consultants or support groups."

    tips: [
      "Wait until breastfeeding is well-established (usually 3-4 weeks) before introducing pumping.",
      "Pump after morning feeds when supply is typically highest.",
      "Store milk in clean containers - use BPA-free bottles or breast milk storage bags.",
      "Fresh milk can be stored at room temperature (4 hours), in refrigerator (4 days), or freezer (6-12 months).",
      "Label milk with date and time - use oldest milk first.",
      "Thaw frozen milk in refrigerator or warm water - never use microwave.",
      "Shake milk gently to mix the fat that may have separated - don't shake vigorously."

      "Continue taking your prenatal vitamins or switch to postnatal vitamins.",
      "Include healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil) for your baby's brain development.",
      "Eat enough calories - breastfeeding requires about 500 extra calories per day.",
      "Limit caffeine to 200-300mg per day (about 2-3 cups of coffee).",
      "Avoid alcohol, or wait 2-3 hours after drinking before breastfeeding."
