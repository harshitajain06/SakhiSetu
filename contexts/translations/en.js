        mythStatement: 'It is forbidden to cook food during your period.',
        factCheck: 'This is a myth based on cultural taboos, not on science or hygiene. There is no medical or biological reason that prevents a woman from cooking while menstruating.',
        scientificFacts: [
          'Menstruation is a normal bodily process, not a state of impurity.',
          'Cooking during your period does not contaminate food or affect anyone\'s health.',
          'These restrictions often originated in traditional beliefs about \'purity,\' not in scientific understanding.',
          'With good hygiene, cooking while on your period is completely safe and normal.'
        ],
        healthyTip: 'If you feel cramps or fatigue, you can choose to rest — but that\'s about comfort, not forbidden rules.',
        conclusion: 'Cooking during your period is not forbidden. It\'s a personal choice, and menstruation has no impact on food safety or cleanliness.'
